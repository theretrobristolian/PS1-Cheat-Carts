"Memory Card" Improved memory card access timing (compatible with 8 cards)
Added command line passing function
When fast forwarding or rewinding on "CD-ROM," the amount of change will increase if you press the key for a certain period of time.
HBP, BREAK handling bug fix
Some changes to the strings in the English mode configuration

1998/5/31  - version 0.31
Added English mode. You can switch language modes with SELECT+L2. Nick Des Barres , /P and his friends provided great help
with the English text . Thank you very much.
Added a screen save function when waiting for communication. In the communication standby mode, which can be used by setting "PAR Switch OFF Start" in "Configuration" to "Communication Standby," the screen will turn off if there is no communication or the pad is not touched for a certain period of time (about 60 seconds). It will return to normal when communication is received.
Reversal of switch function when starting from communication standby state. When starting a program from communication standby state, the interpretation of the switch is reversed. This is because the switch is OFF when communication is standby, so if it was left as it was, the PAR hook would not work, which was rather inconvenient.
Reduction of cheat code area. Due to the increasing size of the program, the cheat code registration area has been reduced from 32KB to 16KB, and the selection code registration area (used while the game is running) has been reduced from 8KB to 4KB.
Fixed a bug where SLOT1 and SLOT2 were not displayed correctly in the "Memory Card Manager".
Fixed a bug that caused the "Memory Card Manager" to go out of control when an access error occurred.
Fixed the issue where the screen display was shifted downwards.

First Release

General Notes & Feature Highlights\
----------------------------------\
- Caetla was a GameShark firmware replacement for the original white-cart PlayStation GameShark, enabling out-of-region and pirated disc booting on unmodified hardware :contentReference[oaicite:3]\{index=3\}.\
\
- A major drawback of later versions was that they stored the cheat database in a memory-card file\'97but the utility to generate that file appears to be lost :contentReference[oaicite:4]\{index=4\}.\
  > As one user noted, \'93there used to be a utility to create memory card saves with cheats, but I can't seem to find the download anywhere.\'94 :contentReference[oaicite:5]\{index=5\}\
\
- Another user on ASSEMblerGames confirmed that \'93the later versions of Caetla store the cheat database on a memory card,\'94 and that updating required an old ISA comms-link card\'97though a parallel-port clone (Freewing) could be used as a workaround :contentReference[oaicite:6]\{index=6\}.\
\
- Caetla\'92s advanced cheat code support in version 0.34 (or the possibly hacked .341 variant) added indirect write capability, powerful increment/decrement codes, and GameShark flags, greatly enhancing its cheating flexibility :contentReference[oaicite:7]\{index=7\}.\
\
- There is evidence in Unirom documentation that it supports dual-booting with Caetla, though this relates to Unirom\'92s broader features including memory-card booting, file browsing, and debugging tools :contentReference[oaicite:8]\{index=8\}.\
